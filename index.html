<h1>Hello there</h1>
<img src="images/test.jpg">
<p>My name is Conor James MacDonald. I am a post-doc researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, and an associated researcher at INSERM U1018 in France. I completed my PhD in 2019 at the unviersity of Dundee. My focus was the epidemiology of vascular access in dialysis patients, and assessment of potential imaging techniques that could be used in this population. I also hold a masters degree in physics from the unviersity of st andrews.</p>
<p>My research interests lie in using causal inference techniques to determine what works in medicine, and in preventing disease. I also have an interest in obesity and nutritional epidemiology, due to thier unique methodological challenges.</p>
<p>On this page I will host information about my research, some manuscripts, and code.</p>
<p>My first postdoc in France involved investigating lifestyle and comorbidities in relation to cardiovascular diseases, in a large prospective study of women. Some papers are hosted <a href="https://conormacdonaldepi.github.io/E3N-studies/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://conormacdonaldepi.github.io/nutritional-epidemiology/">Click here</a> for nutritional epidemiology. Some work was done as part of my first postdoc, and some more methodological pieces are more recent. </p>


<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
